       "Ansible is an open-source automation tool for IT infrastructure management, encompassing configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It enables users to define system configurations and automate tasks using simple, human-readable YAML files called playbooks. Ansible operates without requiring agents on managed nodes, connecting via SSH or Windows Remote Management, which simplifies deployment and reduces overhead. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_%28software%29?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "Developed by Michael DeHaan in 2012 and acquired by Red Hat in 2015, Ansible supports various operating systems, including Linux, Unix-like systems, macOS, and Windows. Its agentless architecture allows for straightforward automation of tasks across diverse environments. Ansible's modular design enables users to extend its functionality, and its idempotent nature ensures that repeated executions yield consistent results, enhancing reliability and predictability in system management.

### 1. Current Company Status and Health

As of December 31, 2024, Tesla held approximately $36.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, surpassing its total debt. This strong liquidity position enables Tesla to sustain operations and fund ongoing growth initiatives despite recent operational challenges. The company’s governance quality scores well (ISS Governance QualityScore of 10 as of August 2025), indicating solid corporate governance including audit quality and shareholder rights, which fosters investor confidence.

Environmental impact remains a core strength, with Tesla’s products enabling customers to avoid around 32 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions in 2024, reinforcing Tesla’s leading role in sustainable mobility and clean energy solutions.

However, Tesla experienced a 1.1% decline in annual vehicle sales in 2024—the first since 2011—reflecting emerging demand pressures. Additionally, quarterly profit margins have softened compared to previous years, signaling the need for operational efficiency improvements and demand stabilization.

### 2. Historical Company Performance

Tesla’s financial trajectory has been impressive, displaying rapid revenue and profitability growth since its 2018 baseline of $7 billion to nearly $98 billion in 2024. Although the revenue growth rate decelerated to about 0.95% year-over-year in 2024, this follows several years of nearly 20% annual expansion, indicating Tesla is maturing into a sizable, established enterprise.

Profitability also tracked upwards through the early 2020s with retained earnings approximating $27.8 billion by late 2023. Tesla’s stock price peaked near $479 in late 2024, reflecting market optimism despite elevated valuation multiples and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. Tesla sustains dominant market share in the US, controlling over 55% of the EV segment as of 2023, underscoring its leading competitive position.

Chosen Company: Perplexity AI

Why Perplexity AI was chosen:
Perplexity AI is the top investment choice due to its extraordinary growth trajectory, rapid expansion in user base and revenue, and dominant position in the burgeoning AI search market. Between 2023 and 2025, Perplexity AI increased its monthly queries from 400 million to 780 million, while its valuation skyrocketed from $150 million in early 2023 to $18 billion after a $100 million funding round by mid-2025. Revenue grew by 41% from $24 million in 2023 to $34 million in 2024, fueled by subscriptions and enterprise offerings. The AI search industry is expected to keep expanding rapidly, benefiting from a broader surge in AI adoption across all sectors, with AI industry valuations predicted to rise by 500% over the next five years. With substantial funding, exponential engagement, and a strong moat through technological innovation, Perplexity AI demonstrates unmatched scaling potential—making it the most attractive investment opportunity among the candidates.

Companies Not Selected and Reasons:

1. Beehiiv
Beehiiv shows robust growth as a newsletter platform focused on creators, with ARR rising from $12 million in 2023 to a projected $30 million in 2025. The newsletter/SaaS creator economy is a growing space, and Beehiiv’s adoption rates and innovation are noteworthy. However, its market is more niche and exposed to intense competition from well-established legacy players (like Substack, Mailchimp), which could pressure margins and slow scalability. While the growth outlook is positive, the scale and transformative potential relative to Perplexity AI are smaller.

2. PlayHT
PlayHT is an AI-driven voice generation startup experiencing significant adoption in education and business communication. The AI voice market is projected to surge from $3 billion in 2024 to over $20 billion by 2030 with a strong CAGR. PlayHT benefits from early-mover advantage, and its market—while large—is still maturing, and may be subject to commodity pricing and rapid technological changes. PlayHT is promising but slightly less de-risked and less far along in absolute growth and market impact compared to Perplexity AI.

3. DoorLoop
DoorLoop is making notable strides in proptech, especially in property management automation, addressing a large and under-digitized addressable market in the U.S. Projected to grow at 7.7% CAGR, the property management software sector offers healthy expansion opportunities. DoorLoop’s automation is a strong differentiator, but the sector’s growth rate and overall market excitement are less pronounced than in AI search. Additionally, fragmentation and variable digitization rates across geographies may slow broad adoption compared to the AI-first, global growth characteristics of Perplexity AI.

Summary:
Perplexity AI demonstrates the most compelling combination of exponential growth, market dominance, substantial funding, and future-proof business model in a category set to transform multiple industries. While Beehiiv, PlayHT, and DoorLoop all exhibit strong sector performance and solid business models, their market sizes, competitive threats, and scalability are not as high-impact or as uniquely positioned as Perplexity AI’s in 2024-2025. Thus, Perplexity AI is the clear investment leader.

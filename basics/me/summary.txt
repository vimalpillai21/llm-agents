My name is Vimal Pillai. I am a Senior AI/ML Engineer, Data Scientist, and Full-Stack Python Developer. I was born and raised in New Delhi and moved to Kerala in 2017.
I enjoy all types of food, especially spicy dishes, and my favorite drink is lassi. I am passionate about exploring new technologies in AI/ML and DevOps, and I love coding on platforms like Kaggle and GitHub.
I maintain a strict workâ€“life balance and keep conversations in the office professional, avoiding unnecessary personal details. In my free time, I enjoy streaming and playing video games on Discord, Facebook, and Instagram.
I prefer to maintain a low profile and surround myself with people who have supported me throughout my life.

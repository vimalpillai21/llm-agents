       "This example demonstrates a fundamental pattern for building a **lock-free, memory-safe, concurrent hash map** in Rust. For production-grade systems, extensive testing, proper deletion, resize strategies, and a proven concurrent algorithm are necessary. Libraries like [dashmap](https://docs.rs/dashmap) and [flurry](https://docs.rs/flurry) provide high-performance concurrent maps, but they often use internal locking or have different safety guarantees.\n",
